# FORGE.md — <PROJECT_NAME>

> Canonical rich source of project governance. Humans and Forge edit **this** file.
> `AGENTS.md` at the repo root is a **generated** operational projection (run `forge sync-adapters`);
> `CLAUDE.md`, `QWEN.md`, `GEMINI.md` symlink to `AGENTS.md`. Never edit generated files.

## 1. Identity

The YAML frontmatter above is the canonical project identity. Agents resolve empty fields at
runtime (`gh repo view`, MCP Atlassian) and persist them here. Durable stack context and
cross-project conventions live in [`context.md`](./context.md); non-negotiable principles live
in [`constitution.md`](./constitution.md).

## 2. SDD policy

- **Default rigor: `spec-anchored`** — living spec + verification against it. `spec-first` is
  allowed for disposable prototypes; `spec-as-source` only for mature contracts/generators
  (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Protobuf, schemas, SDKs, migrations).
- **Change-based lifecycle:** every feature/bugfix/refactor lives in
  `.forge/specs/active/<change-id>/` (manifest, requirements, design, tasks, stories, deltas,
  evidence). The verified baseline lives in `.forge/product/current/` and is **only** modified
  by `/forge:archive`. Never edit `product/current/` by hand.
- **Scale-adaptive levels (0..4):** the manifest `scale` field decides mandatory phases —
  0: tasks only · 1: short requirements + tasks · 2 (default): requirements + design + tasks ·
  3: + analyze + story sharding · 4: + FRD/NFRD/TRD/DDD + explicit regulatory approval.
  Choosing below the suggested risk level records skipped phases + justification in the manifest.

## 2.1 Source-of-truth precedence (authority order)

When two sources contradict each other, the **higher-authority** source wins; the lower one is
**drift to fix**, not a valid alternative. Order, highest first:

1. **`constitution.md`** — non-negotiable principles.
2. **Baseline** — accepted **ADRs** and `product/current/capabilities/` (the law in force).
3. **Rules** — `.forge/rules/**` (conventions derived from decisions; a rule that codifies an
   architectural decision must declare its `based_on:` ADR).
4. **`context.md` / defaults** — durable stack/convention context.

An agent **never silently picks** a lower source over a higher one, and **never guesses** the
precedence. If a rule contradicts an accepted ADR, the ADR governs and the rule is reported as
drift (see `.forge/rules/conventions/conflict-handling.md`). A relevant architectural conflict is
**blocking** — stop and escalate via the human gate; do not "register and proceed".

## 3. How to work

1. **Read specs first.** Active change: `.forge/specs/active/<change-id>/`. Current truth:
   `.forge/product/current/capabilities/`. Never reconstruct state from chat memory.
2. **Use the graph before raw reads** (when enabled): query/path/explain via `/forge:graph`,
   impact via `/forge:impact` (mandatory for scale ≥ 3).
3. **Worktrees:** every change works in `.forge/worktrees/<change-id>/` — inside the project,
   never outside. The worktree-guard hook blocks anything else. Worktrees are removed after merge.
4. **Branches:** `feature/<change-id>` → PR to `develop` → merge after human gate → promotion
   to `staging` triggers the only expensive CI run.
5. **Validate before declaring done:** run the commands in `runtime:` (test/typecheck/lint) plus
   the deterministic gates (`.forge/scripts/`). Human gates are presented as explicit options
   (approve/review/reject/supersede/abandon/block) and recorded in `approvals.yaml`.
6. **Archive:** `/forge:archive <change-id>` applies spec deltas to the baseline after verified
   implementation (pre-flight: manifest valid, tasks 100%, verification + approvals + traceability
   present). To end a change without touching the baseline use `/forge:close --reason
   abandoned|rejected|superseded`.

## 4. Language and commits

- Code identifiers in **English**; documentation and user-facing text in **Português Brasileiro**.
  "Objeto de Valor" is always written in full. Repository names never embed technology.
- Conventional Commits, imperative pt-BR subject, no AI co-authorship lines — ever.

## 5. Customization

Repo-local overrides live in `.forge/custom/` and take precedence over template files of the same
relative path (no fork needed). `forge doctor` flags orphan overrides as drift.

## 6. Layers (where things live)

| Layer | Root | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Project Brain | `FORGE.md`, `forge.yaml`, `constitution.md`, `context.md`, `rules/`, `adapters/` | governance |
| 2 Spec Lifecycle | `specs/active/`, `specs/archived/`, `product/current/` | SDD change-based |
| 3 Execution Harness | `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, `scripts/`, `worktrees/` | operation |
| 4 Understanding | `graph/` | brownfield map, impact, C4 |
| 5 Dev Loop & Quality | `templates/story/`, `evals/`, `runners.yaml` | long-running + quantitative quality (opt-in) |
